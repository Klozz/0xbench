#summary Getting Project Source Code

0xbench project is hosted at http://gitorious.org/0xbench/. Follow below steps, it shows how to set up the building environment, how to download 0xbench source code and how to build-from-scratch.

= Download Source Code =
Use git to clone the source tree from Gitorious:
{{{
git clone git://gitorious.org/0xbench/0xbench.git
}}}

= Building APK (SDK) =
An APK image contains all the built-in Java-based benchmarks and a interface to the native C-based benchmarks, but not the C binaries itself.

== Using Ant ==
 # Download and install Android SDK.
 # Generate local settings file (local.properties) by invoking the command:
{{{
android update project --path 0xbench/
}}}
 # In the project directory (0xbench/), use one of the following commands to build APK depend on your needs:
{{{
ant debug     // generate a debug APK, you need to setup debug keystore in advance
ant release   // generate a debug APK, you need to setup release keystore in advance
ant install   // install directly to connected device or emulator
}}}
 # The produced APK file can be found under `/path/to/0xbench/bin/`. You can now deploy it to you devices using adb:
{{{
adb install bin/Benchmark-*.apk
}}}

== Using Eclipse ==
 # Download and install Android SDK and Eclipse IDE.

= Building and Deploying Standalone Binaries (NDK) =

 # Download and install both Android SDK and Android NDK.
 # In the project directory (0xbench), build binaries with the command:
{{{
/path/to/ndk/ndk-build
}}}
 # The binaries can be found under `/path/to/0xbench/libs/armeabi/bench_*`. Use root permission to mount `/system` with rw permission, and use adb to deploy:
{{{
adb push /path/to/0xbench/libs/armeabi/bench_* /system/bin/
}}}

= Building Everything with Source Tree (0xdroid) =
 # Download and build the 0xdroid source tree.
 # Setup build environment:
{{{
cd /path/to/0xdroid/
source build/envsetup.sh
export TOP=`pwd`
}}}
 # Build APK and binaries:
{{{
cd /path/to/0xbench/
mm
}}}
 # APK can be found in:
{{{
/path/to/0xdroid/target/product/arch/system/app/ZeroXBenchmark.apk
}}}
 # Binaries can be found in:
{{{
/path/to/0xdroid/target/product/arch/system/bin/bench_*
}}}
