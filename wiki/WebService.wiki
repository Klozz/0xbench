= Introduction =

Beside saving or benchmarking results to the SD Card (either plain text or XML), 0xbench can also upload your results to a web service that provide visual representation of your results.This article explains in detail the steps needed to upload and how to interpret the results.

= Uploading =
== Default Benchmark Pages ==
 # Complete running selected benchmarking cases
 # Return to main view and click "Upload"
 # Uncheck "Login", and click the "Send" button
 # Point your browser to the URL reported on your phone

== Creating your own page ==
 # Use any browser to point to http://0xbench.appspot.com/
 # Login with your google account to acquire an API key

 # On your phone, check the "Login" checkbox and enter your email address, API key, and choose a desire benchmark page name
 # Click send to create your own page on the web

= Web Interface =

There are five regions in the Web Interface. At the top is a tabbar that switch to view different benchmark categories.

The Option Section controls how the Main Table (third section) will be displayed. Detail of the option section will be explained in latter sections of this article.

The Main Table display results of multiple runs (uploads). Each benchmarking case is presented with a average performance number, and different types of graph representation. All the cases are also assigned with tags so that it's visibility can be controlled via the Option Section. 

The Runs Section display details of different runs, including benchmark execution date/time, phone model, kernel version, etc. You can also name/rename or delete a run, if you are the page owner.

In the last section, the Tag Section, All the cases are listed with the tags that are assigned to it. 

== Options ==

The Options Section controls how the Main Table is displayed. These controls include:
 * The visibility of runs and benchmarking cases can be control directly or via tags.
 * Tagging mode (union or filtering)
 * Type of graph to display (bar graph, distribution, stacked distribution, or statistics)
 * Bar graphs should be comparing locally (cases within same run) or globally (all cases in all runs)
 * Page permission control
The Permission Field in the Options Section controls who have access to this page. The page owner can enter a semicolon separated list of gmail accounts to grant access. Including a "public" string in the list of account names will open the benchmark page to the public, regardless of whether the user is in the list or not.

=== Bar Graph ===

If a benchmarking case if consists of multiple result values, the bar graph can display five different values, using different colors and T indicators:
 # The left-side T indicates the minimum measured value.
 # The left-hand edge of the lighter-colored sections is the first quartile. 25% of the measurements are below this value; 75% are above it.
 # The middle edge that divides the two lighter-colored sections is the median. 50% of the measurements are below this value; 50% are above it.
 # The right-hand edge of the lighter-colored sections is the third quartile. 75% of the measurements are below this value; 25% are above it.
 # The right-side T indicates the maximum measured value.
Many bars will not have all of these features. In that case, the omitted feature is not interesting: it is equal to the adjacent value. If all measurements are exactly equal, then the minimum, first-quartile, median, third-quartile and maximum will all be together at the bar's end.
